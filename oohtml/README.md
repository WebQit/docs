## Why OOHTML

Think an all-new ability to author the UI from modular, reusable parts that are also auto-updating (or reactive) with the state of an appliaction - this time, **not with some kind of a framework, but out of the native web platform itself**! This is the prospect now held community-wide that OOHTML seeks to fullfil! OOHTML comes with all modern UI development paradigms built into the plain old HTML so you can go without a tool.

> **OOHTML is being proposed as a [W3C standard at the Web Platform Incubator Community Group](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-chtml/4716). Consider bringing your ideas to the discussion.**
