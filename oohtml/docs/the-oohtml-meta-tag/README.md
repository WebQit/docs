# The OOHTML Meta Tag
OOHTML provides a meta tag for customizing its syntax or behaviour. It generally looks like this:

```html
<meta name="oohtml" content="prop1=val1; prop2=val2;">
```

*The actual configurable properties are documented across the various OOHTML features.*

Customization can help you keep potential breaking changes under control when there is a change to the default syntax on future updates. For a new and fast-evolving technology, this should be expected.

Customization also lets you explore around the whole new idea, and this should hopefully bring new discoveries to the table. Feel free to bring your findings to the discussion at the [Web Platform Incubator Community Group](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-chtml/4716). You can always file an [issue](https://github.com/webqit/oohtml/issues) to report a bug, ask a question, or raise a suggestion.
