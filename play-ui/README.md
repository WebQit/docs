## About Play UI

Play UI provides a fast and delightful way to create modern User Interfaces. There is [the JavaScript library](docs/js) that lets you work with the DOM and UI in syntactic sugar. There is [the set of CSS libraries](docs/css) that lets you do all the layout and styling that defines the modern UI. Note the conscious goal of not trading standard JavaScript and CSS the usual way for some proprietary syntax!
